Visible changes:
The configuration dialog has been revamped with tabs.
It is cleaner, easier to understand and to find options.
This allows for adding many future options while keeping it simple.
One option has been added in the window tab to make the keyboard semi-transparent.
Two other options have been added to make auto-hide experience better.
First one is the move_to_widget options which was always on before. You can now disable it and prevent the keyboard from moving to the selected widget (this is now he default).
Second one is the intermediate icon option which makes Florence less intrusive when you just want to read a document and not edit it with the keyboard. Enable this option and a small icon will appear instead of the keyboard. Just click on that icon to make the actual keyboard appear.
Many bugs concerning auto-hide mode has also been fixed, so this mode is now fairly usable (still only with at-spi enabled applications, meaning all gtk apps, firefox, openoffice, java apps and some others).
Last and least, the super key has been rebranded with Florence smile in the hope it will help you keeping your smile.

Infrastructure changes:
The xml files and implementation method for reading them have been cleaned up.
It is more easy to extend and take less space on disk.
The code has also been cleaned up to use less memory, be more robust and more efficient.
As a result, resizing the window is a little smoother.
