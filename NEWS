The most visible change of this version is its speed. It starts more quickly and is more responsive.
Under the hood, I have redesigned all the drawing system to use less memory with cairo and librsvg instead of libgnomecanvas and libart.
I have also swaped xml schema validation for relax-ng (compact syntax) validation of the layout file. This is much more readable and maintainable.
Also on the news is that florence is now on Fedora 9 official repository, thanks to Simon Wesp.
