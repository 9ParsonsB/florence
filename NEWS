This is mainly a bug fix release.
The high CPU workload problem has been fixed.
Documentation has been moved to gnome-doc-utils.
Florence now listens to keys-changed events. It means that you can switch layout without restarting the program.
Note that the Xorg RECORD extension is broken since version 1.6. Because of this, Florence does not work correctly when using the Xtest extension. Please compile Florence without xtest if you are using Xorg 1.6: use the --without-xtst configure option.
