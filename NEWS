This release lowers the entry barrier to compile Florence.
Now the XKB extension is optional: the --without-xkb configure option will disable it. The drawback is that Florence will not read the real keyboard status at startup, so locker keys like CAPS_LOCK will be ignored if they are set when Florence is launched. ake sure all locker keys are released with launching Florence without xkb.
The aim is to be able to run florence on X servers with the XKB extension like Exceed.
The at-spi registry daemon has also been made optional because many systems don't have it. You can disable it with the --without-at-spi option at configure time. This will disable auto-hide mode as this mode does not work without the at-spi registry daemon.
