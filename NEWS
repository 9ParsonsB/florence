This is mainly a bug fix release.
The high CPU workload problem has been fixed.
Documentation has been moved to gnome-doc-utils.
Florence now listens to keys-changed events. It means that you can switch layout without restarting the program.
Note that the Xorg RECORD extension is broken since version 1.6. Because of this, Florence with xrecord does not work correctly with recent distros like Ubuntu 9.04, Mandriva 2009.1 or Fedora 11. Please compile Florence without xrecord if you are using Xorg 1.6: use the --without-xrecord configure option.
