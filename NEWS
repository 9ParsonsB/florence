Florence now collaborates with the real keyboard, so for example if push the real CAPS_LOCK key Florence knows it and updates itself (requires libxtst).
There is a new startup notification giving some basic informations on Florence usage. You can disable it permanently by clicking on the 'Do not show again' button and it can be disables at compile time with --without-notify.
Now style changes are applied immediately so you can see the result directly. You can still cancel them before exiting the settings dialog.
Windows gravity set to static so it does not move when you switch decorated flag.
Internationalize key labels and localize in french.
Some minor bugs have been fixed.
