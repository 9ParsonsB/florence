"Florence is an extensible scalable virtual keyboard for GNOME. You need it "
"if you can't use a real hardware keyboard, for example because you are "
"disabled, your keyboard is broken or because you use a tablet PC, but you "
"must be able to use a pointing device (as a mouse, a trackball, or a "
"touchscreen); If you can't use a pointing device, there is gok, which can be "
"used with just simple switches."
