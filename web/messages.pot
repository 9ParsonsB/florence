"Florence is an extensible scalable virtual keyboard for GNOME. You need it "
"if you can't use a real hardware keyboard, for example because you are "
"disabled, your keyboard is broken or because you use a tablet PC, but you "
"must be able to use a pointing device (as a mouse, a trackball, a "
"touchscreen or <a href=\"http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/opengazer"

"can be used with just simple switches."
