FLORENCE: A simple virtual keyboard for Gnome
*********************************************

http://florence.sourceforge.net
Florence is a virtual keyboard for GNOME. You need it if you can't use a real keyboard
either because of a handicap, disease, broken keyboard or tablet PC but you can use a 
pointing device. If you can't use a pointing device, there is gok:

DEPENDANCIES
************

      * gtk >= 2.10
      * libgnomecanvas >= 2.0
      * cspi >= 1.0

QUICK INSTALL
*************

      $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
      $ make
      $ su
      # make install

UNINSTALL
*********

      # make uninstall


QUICK USAGE
***********

First you need to activate technical help in Gnome:
Go to System->settings->technical help (or somewhere near there).
Activate the technical help with the check button.
Click close and disconnect: this will close your Gnome session.
Florence can be launched by the applications menu (under Accessibility).
The icon in the systray indicates that Florence is running. Click on it to make the
keyboard appear/disappear.
If Florence is in waiting moder, Florence will appear if you click on an editable widget
(like the address bar in epiphany or the text area in a text editor). If you click on an
uneditable widget, Florence will disappear.
If you don't like this behaviour, you can switch to normal virtual keyboard always on 
screen.
The configuration file for that is there /usr/local/etc/florence.conf
To edit it:
$ gedit /usr/local/etc/florence.conf
(note: you may need to be root to do that)
Set ShowOnEditable (in the [Settings] section) to false and restart Florence.
It is a very good idea to also set Shaped to false then, or you won't be able to move
Florence around anymore.
You have also the AutoClick setting which sets the number of milliseconds the mouse is
over the key before the key is automatically pressed. If you don't want auto click, set
it to 0.
You can also change the colours in the [Colors] section.
You can set the zoom factor that determines the size of the window in the [Window]
section.
You don't need to touch other settings for now.
