FLORENCE: A simple virtual keyboard for Gnome
*********************************************

http://florence.sourceforge.net
Florence is a virtual keyboard for GNOME. You need it if you can't use a real keyboard
either because of a handicap, disease, broken keyboard or tablet PC but you can use a 
pointing device. If you can't use a pointing device, there is gok:

Florence is scalable and out of your way when you don't need it.
It appears on the screen only when you need it.
There is an aauto-click functionality To help people having difficulties to use the 
click button, there is an auto-click functionality.

DEPENDANCIES
************

      * gtk >= 2.10
      * libgnomecanvas >= 2.0
      * cspi >= 1.0
      * libgconf >= 2.0
      * libglade >= 2.0
      * libxml >= 2.0

QUICK INSTALL
*************

      * Make sure you have all the dependancies installed.
        Ubuntu/debian: use the following commands to install dependancies:

            $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libxml2-dev libgconf2-dev libglade2-dev \
              libatspi-dev libatspi-dev
            
      * Open a terminal and type (don't type the $ or #):

            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
            $ make
            $ su
            # make install
            (for ubuntu, replace the last two commands with "sudo make install")

UNINSTALL
*********

      # make uninstall
      (for ubuntu, "sudo make uninstall")


QUICK USAGE
***********

Florence can be launched by the applications menu (under Accessibility).
The icon in the systray indicates Florence is running. Click on the icon to make the
keyboard appear/disappear.
If Florence is not in "always on screen" mode, it will appear when you click on an editable
widget (like the address bar in epiphany or the text area in a text editor). When you click
on an uneditable widget, Florence will disappear.
If you don't like this behaviour, you can switch to normal virtual keyboard always on 
screen: right click on the Florence notification icon, choose the preferences menu and
check the 'Always on screen' button.
Auto-click timeout is configurable on the preferences window. It is set in milliseconds.
When the mouse is over for more than the auto-click timeout, the key is automatically
pressed.
Set auto-click to 0 to deactivate it.

RUNNING FLORENCE ON XFCE
************************

This works on any desktop environment actually.
You need to start the at-spi redistry daemon at session startup:
add this line to your ~/.xinitrc file before the last command (for xfce it is probably
startxfce4):
     /usr/libexec/at-spi-registryd &
Some distro may put the at-spi-registryd command elsewhere. Use the find command to find
out if your distro did indeed put the command under /usr/libexec:
     find /usr -name at-spi-registryd
And adapt your .xinitrc according to the result.
GNOME does start the daemon automatically if it is configured with the gnome-at-property
dialog.
If your DE is XDG compliant (like XFCE), Florence should be accessible via the menu.
Anyway, starting florence from the command line will always work.

RUNNING FLORENCE ON KDE
***********************

Florence can work on KDE, provided you install all the dependancies (including GTK and
the at-spi registry daemon).
You must start the at-spi registry daemon at session startup.
QT applications don't support at-spi yet. You can still use Florence on screen, but the
keyboard won't detect QT editable widgets. This makes Florence unusable in hidden mode on
KDE, unless you don't use QT applications, but that is highly unlikely on KDE.
Always check "always on screen" on KDE.
