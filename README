QUICK INSTALL
*************

      * Make sure you have all the dependancies installed.
      * Open a terminal and type (don't type the $ or #):

            $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
            $ make
            $ su
            # make install

UNINSTALL
*********

      # make uninstall


QUICK USAGE
***********

Florence can be launched by the applications menu (under Accessibility).
The icon in the systray indicates Florence is running. Click on the icon to make the
keyboard appear/disappear.
If Florence is not in "always on screen" mode, it will appear when you click on an editable
widget (like the address bar in epiphany or the text area in a text editor). When you click
on an uneditable widget, Florence will disappear.
If you don't like this behaviour, you can switch to normal virtual keyboard always on 
screen: right click on the Florence notification icon, choose the preferences menu and
check the 'Always on screen' button.
Auto-click timeout is configurable on the preferences window. It is set in milliseconds.
When the mouse is over for more than the auto-click timeout, the key is automatically
pressed.
Set auto-click to 0 to deactivate it.
