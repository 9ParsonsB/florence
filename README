FLORENCE: A simple virtual keyboard for Gnome
*********************************************

http://florence.sourceforge.net
Florence is a virtual keyboard for GNOME. You need it if you can't use a real keyboard
either because of a handicap, disease, broken keyboard or tablet PC but you can use a 
pointing device. If you can't use a pointing device, there is gok:

QUICK USAGE
***********

First you need to activate technical help in Gnome:
open a terminal and type :
$ gnome_at_properties
Activate the technical help with the check button.
Click close and disconnect: this will close your Gnome session.
Florence can be launched by the applications menu (under Accessibility).
The icon in the systray indicates that Florence is running. Click on it to make the
keyboard appear/disappear.
If Florence is in waiting mode, Florence will appear if you click on an editable widget
(like the address bar in epiphany or the text area in a text editor). If you click on an
uneditable widget, Florence will disappear.
If you don't like this behaviour, you can switch to normal virtual keyboard always on 
screen: right click on the Florence notification icon, choose the preferences menu and
check the 'Always on screen' button.
