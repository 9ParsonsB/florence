/*! \class Key
  * \brief This class represents a key on the keyboard.
  *
  * The Key class is a QGraphicsSvgItem that renders a key on the Florence keyboard.
  * It is loaded from a &lt;key&gt; element in the XML layout file.
  * The &lt;key&gt; element is structured as follow:
  * \code
  * <key>
  *    <code>code</code>
  *    <xpos>xpos</xpos>
  *    <ypos>ypos</ypos>
  *    <width>width</width>
  *    <height>height</height>
  *    <shape>shape name</same>
  *    <bounds>bounds commands</bounds>
  * </key>
  * \endcode
  * where:
  * <ul>
  *    <li><i>code</i> is the key code that is represented in the keymap file.</li>
  *    <li><i>xpos</i> and <i>ypos</i> represent the coordinates of the key in the layout, in layout coordinates.</li>
  *    <li><i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are optional and represent the size of the key in the layout, in layout units.
  *        The default is ( 2, 2 )</li>
  *    <li><i>shape name</i> is optional and is the name of the style shape as found in the style file.
  *        The default is "default"</li>
  *    <li><i>bounds commands</i> is optional and represents the bounds of the key in layout coordinates.
  *        The bounds represents a polygon that contains the key. It is used to detect if a key is hit by touch or not.
  *        It is defined by a list of commands that draw the polygon. There are 2 valid commands:
  *        <ul>
  *           <li>the &lt;m&gt; (move) command is always the first command to start the polygon.
  *               It sets the coordinates to start the polygon as follow: &lt;m x="x" y="y"/&gt;, where x and y are the coordinates to move to, in key coordinates.</li>
  *           <li>the &lt;l&gt; ( line: &lt;l x="x" y="y"/&gt; ) command draws a line from the last position to the new specified position.</li>
  *        </ul>
  *        A final line is drawn from the last point to the first to close the polygon.
  *        If not specified, the bounds of the key is a rectangle at the position and of the size of the key.
  * </ul>
  *
  * The keys are painted in accordance with the Settings object provided in the constructor and redraw themselves when the settings are changed.
  *
  * The keys trigger an action when they are pressed. The action triggered depends on the Keymap configuration for the code of the key.
  * The Keymap dictates the behaviour of the key.
  * There are 3 kinds of keys:
  * <ul>
  *   <li>The non modifier keys are used to input text in an input widget. They can have 2 states: KEY_PRESSED and KEY_RELEASED.
  *       Initially, all keys are released. They become pressed on press for 200ms and return to the released state after that. Pressed keys are displayed in red.</li>
  *   <li>The modifier keys modify the symbol of the non modifier keys. Modifier keys have 4 states: KEY_RELEASED, KEY_PRESSED, KEY_LATCHED and KEY_LOCKED.
          A released modifier becomes latched when pressed. Latched keys are green. It will stay latched until another non modifier key is pressed or until it is pressed again.
          When another key is pressed, it becomes released. If pressed again, it becomes locked. locked keys stay locked until pressed again.</li>
  *   <li>The locker keys are modifier keys with only 2 states: KEY_RELEASED and KEY_LOCKED. They become locked when pressed and released when pressed again.</li>
  * </ul>
