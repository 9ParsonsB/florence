/*! \mainpage
  * \section main Reference documentation of Florence Virtual Keyboard for Qt.
  * \subsection intro Introduction
  * Florence-QT is a virtual keyboard that can be used to input text in an input widget.
  * This document is the reference documentation for developers.
  * \subsection start Getting started
  * The only class you need to use is the Florence class.
  * Florence is a QWidget that can be integrated in your QT application.
  * You can connect your input widget's slots to Florence's signals.
  *
  * Read the <a href="../tutorial/tutorial.html">hello world tutorial</a> for step by step instructions.
  * Compile and try the demo application to learn more about the possibilities offered.
  */

/*! \class Florence
  * \brief This class represents a keyboard widget
  *
  * The Florence class is a QGraphicsView and inherits QWidget.
  * Florence renders a visually appealing keyboard inside a QWidget that can be controlled by the application.
  * Florence provides a way to input text in another text edit widget.
  *
  * The keyboard is optimized for touch input. Keys are magnified when touched and a signal is emitted on touch end.
  * The signal is also sent when keys are held down for longer than 1 second.
  * The keys are auto repeated every 0.2 second for as long as they are held down.
  *
  * One can show and hide the keyboard with the show() and hide() slots (inherited from QWidget),
  * which can be connected to the focusInEvent() and focusOutEvent() methods of the target input widget.
  * Florence sends an inputText() signals to input text in the target widget.
  * The backspace(), enter(), tab() and leftTab() signals are sent when their respective keys are activated.
  *
  * You can find an example of target widget class here:
  * <a href="../../examples/helloworld/lineedit.h">lineedit.h</a>.
  * Class implementation:
  * <a href="../../examples/helloworld/lineedit.cpp">lineedit.cpp</a>.
  *
  * The keymap, the layout and the style can be read from an xml file
  * by calling the setKeymap(), setLayout() and setStyle() member functions, respectively.
  * The style is what dictates the visual appearance of the keyboard. It defines the shape of the keys and symbols.
  * The layout defines the how the keys are disposed on the keyboard.
  * The keymap assigns a symbol value to each key that is language dependant.
  * The default files are included in a binary resource inside the library.
  * On some platforms, if Florence is compiled as a static library and you use the default file (by not calling the functions above),
  * it may be necessary to call the Q_INIT_RESOURCE(florence_qt) macro for Florence to display something.
  *
  * Here is an code example for instantiating Florence:
  *
  * \code
  * Florence *f = new Florence( this );
  * f->setLayout( "florence.layout" );
  * f->setStyle( "florence.style" );
  * f->setKeymap( "us.xml" );
  *
  * LineEdit l = new LineEdit( this );
  * QObject::connect( f, SIGNAL(inputText(QString)), l, SLOT(insertText(QString)) );
  * QObject::connect( f, SIGNAL(backspace()), l, SLOT(backSpace()) );
  * f->setFocusProxy( l );
  * \endcode
  *
  * Note the setFocusProxy makes sure Florence doesn't steal the keyboard focus
  * from the input widget so it keeps the cursor displayed.
  * \implements QGraphicsView
  * \implements QDesignerCustomWidgetInterface
