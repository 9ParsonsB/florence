Description: extensible and scalable virtual keyboard for GNOME
 Florence is an extensible scalable virtual keyboard for GNOME.
 .
 It is useful when a real keyboard is unusable either because of a handicap,
 disease, broken keyboard or tablet PC; but when a pointing device is usable.
 .
 Florence stays out of your way: it appears on the screen only when needed.
 An auto-click functionality also help people having difficulties to click
 buttons.
